# 2324_explorascience

This repository will be used for the event Explorascience for students' year 2023-2024.

## Objectives

The main goal of the project is to present some AI algorithms to students between 9th and 11th grade.
The algorithms I chose to present are:
- Predictive
- MinMax algorithm
- Wave function collapse

## Predictive

I chose to demonstrate the predictive algorithm using a very easy game: Tic Tac Toe. All the data is stored inside two JSON files [when the player starts](explorascience/tictactoe/Includes/tttPStart) and [when the AI starts](explorascience/tictactoe/Includes/tttIA).

All the code that handles the game and the AI can be found [here](explorascience/tictactoe).

## MinMax algorithm

I chose to demonstrate the MinMax algorithm on Connect 4. This also gives another opportunity to explain to students what a "solved game" is and what it means when we speak about computer vs. human gameplay.

All the code can be found [here](explorascience/connect4).

## Wave function collapse

I chose to demonstrate the wave function collapse algorithm on the Sudoku game. This algorithm is way harder than the other two and calls for a basis of quantum physics to fully understand it, but I found it interesting to show students that we can find links between all sciences.

All the code can be found [here](explorascience/sudoku).

## Slides

The slides provided are in French because the project will be presented to French students. They are of no use if you already know the basics of the code or if you are just interested in how everything is made.

## Disclaimers

Some of the code is not entirely mine and was greatly inspired by other GitHub users.
Here are the links to their repositories:
- [Connect 4](https://github.com/KeithGalli/Connect4-Python)
- [Sudoku](https://github.com/aju22/Sudoku-Bot)

Please pay them a visit; I honestly couldn't have done it without them (lack of time due to my own studies).
